	<h2>Prophet Muhammad (S.)</h2>
	<p>
		<mark><b>Muhammad ibn Abdullah</b></mark> (Arabic: <strong>مُحَمَّد ٱبن عَبْد ٱللَّٰه, </strong>romanized:
		Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh,) was an Arab religious, social, and political leader and the founder of the <u>world
			religion of Islam</u>. According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, divinely inspired to preach and
		confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the
		Seal of the Prophets within Islam. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as
		his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. Muhammad was born approximately 570
		CE in Mecca. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father Abdullah was the son
		of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad's birth. His
		mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather,
		Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a
		mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by
		Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these
		revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way
		of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.<a
